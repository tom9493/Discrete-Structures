# Discrete-Structures-Project
This project scans, parses, and tokenizes an input file to perform discrete mathematical operations. Specifically, it deals with schemes, tuples, rules, and queries that interact with a database.

This was a project done in one of my first coding classes. I naively put all the code in the header classes instead of putting the implementations of functions in .cpp files. The project was still fully functional though.
